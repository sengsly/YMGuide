Update fixed:  Testing with MPC-HC version 1.7.8
===========

1. Using MPC-HC API to control switch audio language
2. Using MPC-HC API to control media seeking without losing focus 
3. Using MPC-HC API to control volume changing, there is no direct method set the volume, so the trick is to reduce the volume to zero and increase the volume by command 5% each command to the required volume.
4. Update to embed MPC-HC video in YMGuide.
5. Add some debugging log to the code
=======2015-02-16
6. Cut to the track like before, for example if song is track #2, will show only the seek bar for the length of track #2, and play only that song.(bugs due to cannot read current chapters)
=======2015-02-21
7. Cutting the tracks works correctly part of the time, just need to make sure that BookmarkTime="Some Number" is calculated correctly for the chapter that is added to the queue.
	(seem the current code don't have this function , as i remember this function already has)
8. During playing in fullscreen mode, when play/pause, issue with slow video motion causing by changing video size.
9. When play and pause if the Status bar is not visible, Play/Pause is not functioning well
10. Lost focus during open new media file.
=======2015-02-28
- Create new build of YMGuide installer using Inno setup
=======2015-03-01
- When I check Fullscreen radio button, it installs but doesn't set it to fullscreen correctly, after I press Ctrl+W then it works fine.
- For now remove the 90 second limit when in client/server mode, so can test client/server.  
- If put the limit to 5 connections that would be great, for more then 5 connections user must register our software.
- There is a client server error ReceivedServer Request File Not Found, I attached the error pop-up, I think its not finding a file, maybe its located somewhere else.  The client server was working before with our old installers, maybe have to use a common directory?
=======2015-03-08
-  Add MSWINSCK.OCX, MSINET.OCX, and COMDLG32.OCX in the installer package.
- Check the potential default paths for MPC-HC.   If exist there, C:\Program Files\MPC-HC, C:\Program Files (x86)\MPC-HC
- Some error running in Windows 7 - not sure what it is, so I'm trying to uninstall and re-install but seems to have same error, maybe need separate Installer for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1
   I think the error I had before was due to the Playlist path, need to change the location due to name changed to YMGuide from SlyGuide
- In full screen player page, sometimes the seek bar and volume does not hide after 5 seconds
		Windows 7 always sending mouse move, so the we save old X and Y of the mouse, unless there is changes in mouse position.

- Put the limit to 5 connections that would be great, for more then 5 connections user must register our software.
- Remove the 90 second limit when in client/server mode, so can test client/server.  
- The playlist files are saved & stored here for me(which is fine and works still, but when I click to save it, cause pop-up error 'subscript out of range'):  C:\Users\KHMERSLY\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Sly Multimedia\SlyGuide\PlayLists
=======2015-04-12
- Add Khmer OS Bokor to installer
- Integrated Scan file into YMGuide ( flash interface need recompiled, but error..finding the issue, no need to change language, default to current language)

Known bugs:

- Remove requirement for wmp.dll in case we are not using
- Scrolling text on fullscreen player
